## Configuration

To use a specific version of Laravel in URLs, use this configuration option in your User Preferences file, or use the "Change Version" command from the command palette:

```
"laravelDocs.version": 11.x
```

**Important:** After modifying the `laravelDocs.version` configuration value, you need to *reload Visual Studio Code* for the changes to take effect.
